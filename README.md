# AS5600-arduino-code
This repository gives a simple arduino code to see the anglular readings from AS5600 absolute magnetic encoder


The code given does not provide measurement in 0 to 360 degrees but the encoders full value output of 0 - 4096.
To get the angles in proper degrees pull the variable totalangle in the code.
We can use such an encoder with use cases like geting live angular mewasurements from stepper motors.
